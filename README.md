# assignment

In this task i have made a API call and the data recieved had various fileds.
From that i have displayed the titles along with the buttons in a table format.
Each title has a button.When you click on the button the pop will be shown which will display the id and title in that row.

In this task i have used HTML5,CSS3 and pure Javascript.
I have not used any frameworks or libraries here only pure JS.

The output of code along with screenshots have been added to the output folder.

Thank you!
